        <h1>About me.</h1>
       <p>Hi my name is Ralf I was born in the Philippines and I'm a Graduate and Former 6th Period Photographer who does Photography but sometimes I expressed it with feelings and being passionate for work and I do work hard at Photography. I totally think what I know myself as an Photographer is that I had some fun times doing editing on the computer and take pictures on my camera which is great but it does use my imagination a lot of times so I think that I'm an good photographer and I do actually do pretty good wide shots and portraits shots for fun and I do have good memories doing Photography Work and I've totally learned a lot about Photography during class times back in High School and even the Outside World too.</p>
